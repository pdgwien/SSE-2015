This service needs two daemons to run:

- forum_lighttpd (start|stop)
- forum_gunicorn (start|stop)

Both daemons need to run, but only forum_gunicorn needs to be restarted to adopt changes in the source files.

The file requirements.txt is only needed if you want to install the necessary requirements for python on your local machine.
You can install these packages with python-pip.

The folder pypi/ holds all the required packages for an offline install.

schema.sql is the SQL scheme of the implemented database table.
